I remember finding so many different kinds of famous cats in 2010's, and of course Maru stood out among them for the videos featuring jumping in boxes.
 </p>
 <p>
The first time I see Maru is in the many images shared online, which were faster to take a break and laugh for a moment.

 <p>
I think it is the combination of Maru with not a small head and their wanting to peek through holes in boxes that are too small.
